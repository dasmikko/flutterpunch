New and fresh Facepunch app, made in Flutter,

## What is planned?
An Android and iOS version

The Android will be made first, as I don't own any iPhones nor Macbook, which makes it not possible for me to debug/test on that platform.

The app *should* work on iOS but, I still need a Macbook and iPhone to test/build.
